= Lab 6 - Leveraging Spring Cloud Connectors for Service Binding

In this lab we'll bind our RESTful web service from link:../lab_05/lab_05.adoc[Lab 5] to a MySQL database and leverage Spring Cloud Connectors to easily connect to it.

NOTE: The completed code for this lab can be found at `$COURSE_HOME/session_03/lab_06/complete/cities`.

== Using Spring Cloud Connectors

. Change to the lab directory (the initial state for this lab is the same as the completed state for link:../lab_05/lab_05.html[Lab 5], so you can choose to continue with that project if you like footnote:[However, please use the copy of `import.sql` found in the `lab_06/initial/cities/src/main/resources` directory. It is a subset of the original dataset, which is necessary because we are using a free tier database service on PWS.]):
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_03/lab_06/initial/cities
----

. At present we're still using the in-memory database. Let's connect to a MySQL database service.
From the CLI, let's _create_ a developer MySQL service instance:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf create-service p-mysql 100mb-dev cities-db
Creating service cities-db...
OK
----

. Next add the service to your application manifest, which will _bind_ the service to our application on the next push. We'll also add an environment variable to switch on the ``cloud'' profile,
+
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: cities
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
  path: build/libs/cities-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  timeout: 180
  services:                        # Add
  - cities-db                      # these
  env:                             # four
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud  # lines
----
+
You can also accomplish the service binding by explicitly binding the service at the command-line:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf bind-service cities cities-db
Binding service cities-db to app cities...
OK
----

. Next we'll add Spring Cloud and MySQL dependencies to our Gradle build. Comment or remove the +hsqldb+ line add add the following in the +dependencies+ section:
+
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    // ....
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-spring-service-connector:1.1.0.RELEASE")
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-connector:1.1.0.RELEASE")
    runtime("org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client:1.1.7")
}
----
+
Since we've added new dependencies, re-run +./gradlew idea+ or +./gradlew eclipse+ to have them added to the IDE classpath.

. Next, let's create the package +org.example.cities.config+ and create in that package the class +CloudDataSourceConfig+. Add the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
@Profile("cloud")
@Configuration
public class CloudDataSourceConfig extends AbstractCloudConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return connectionFactory().dataSource();
    }
}
----
+
As before, have the IDE import the appropriate dependencies.
+
The +@Profile+ annotation will cause this class (which becomes Spring configuration when annotated as +@Configuration+) to be added to the configuration set because of the +SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE+ environment variable we added earlier. You can still run the application locally (with the default profile) using the embedded database.
+
With this code, Spring Cloud will detect a bound service that is compatible with +DataSource+, read the credentials, and then create a +DataSource+ as appropriate (it will throw an exception otherwise).

. Add the following to +src/main/resources/application.properties+ to cause Hibernate to create the database schema and import data at startup. This is done automatically for embedded databases, not for custom ++DataSource++s. Other Hibernate native properties can be set in a similar fashion:
+
[source,java]
----
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
----

. Build the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
----

. Re-push the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----

. Take a look at the +env+ endpoint again to see the service bound in +VCAP_SERVICES+:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://cities-crouse-penance.cfapps.io/env
...
VCAP_SERVICES: "{"p-mysql":[{"name":"cities-db","label":"p-mysql","tags":["mysql","relational"],"plan":"100mb-dev","credentials":{"hostname":"192.168.8.210","port":3306,"name":"cf_c35b685f_00e6_43e9_bed0_67210f562dd9","username":"ru6zHmkfacgv6I3p","password":"cGJArKXEcUPBNXer","uri":"mysql://ru6zHmkfacgv6I3p:cGJArKXEcUPBNXer@192.168.8.210:3306/cf_c35b685f_00e6_43e9_bed0_67210f562dd9?reconnect=true","jdbcUrl":"jdbc:mysql://192.168.8.210:3306/cf_c35b685f_00e6_43e9_bed0_67210f562dd9?user=ru6zHmkfacgv6I3p&password=cGJArKXEcUPBNXer"}}]}",
...
----
The application is now running against a MySQL database.

== Customizing the +DataSource+

. You can customize the database connection that Spring Cloud creates with a few lines of code. Change the +dataSource+ method in +CloudDataSourceConfig+ to add some pooling and connection configuration:
+
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public DataSource dataSource() {
    PooledServiceConnectorConfig.PoolConfig poolConfig =
            new PooledServiceConnectorConfig.PoolConfig(5, 200);

    DataSourceConfig.ConnectionConfig connectionConfig =
            new DataSourceConfig.ConnectionConfig("characterEncoding=UTF-8");
    DataSourceConfig serviceConfig = new DataSourceConfig(poolConfig, connectionConfig);

    return connectionFactory().dataSource("cities-db", serviceConfig);
}
----

. Build the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
----

. Re-push the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----

== Clean Up

Issue the following commands to delete the cities application and its database.

. Delete the `cities` application:
+
----
$ cf d cities

Really delete the app cities?> y
Deleting app cities in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
'OK
----

. Delete the `cities-db` service:
+
----
$ cf ds cities-db

Really delete the service cities-db?> y
Deleting service cf-scale-boot-logs in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----
